### Key Mappings
(Leader key is mapped to space, so all the following shortcuts should be pressed with the space key.)

| Shortcut           | Mode        | Description                               |

| ` k`               | Insert      | Exits insert mode (with delay protection).|

## Plugin Installation

### Install Vim-Plug
1. Run the following command to install vim-plug:

   ```
2. 	Open Vim and run the following command to install all plugins:
   ```vim
   :PlugInstall
  ```
## Plugin Usage

- **NERDTree**:
  - Use ` t` to toggle the file tree.
  - Use `:NERDTreeFind` to highlight the current file in the tree.

- **vim-easy-align**:
  - Select text in visual mode, then run `:EasyAlign` and choose the character to align by.

- **vim-fugitive**:

## Additional Notes

- **New Window Direction**: Split windows (e.g., `:split`) will default to showing **below** (`set splitbelow`).
- **Terminal Integration**: It is recommended to use iTerm2's built-in split window feature for terminal workflows.
